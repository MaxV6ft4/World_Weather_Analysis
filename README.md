# World Weather Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis I added a descripion of the current weather for each city to the list of columns in the hotel dataframe, in order to display the current weather as one of the pop-up markers in the map.  Furthermore I added input statements allowing the user to set the maximum and minimum highs in temperature in order for him or her to narrow down the search for destinations and nearby hotels.  Finally I created a direction layer map to allow the user to pick four cities of his or her choice.  Once picked, the map will display the optimal route between the selected cities.
