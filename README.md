# World Weather Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis I retrieved the weather description for each city when gathering hotel data in order for the map to display the current weather (in addition to the hotel name, city, country and current temperature) as a feature in its pop-up markers.  Furthermore I added input statements allowing the user to set the maximum and minimum highs in temperature in order for him or her to narrow down the search of potential destinations and nearby hotels.  Finally I created a direction layer map to allow the user to pick four cities of his or her choice.  Once picked, the map displays the optimal route between the selected cities.
